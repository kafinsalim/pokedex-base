Another pokedex app.

WIP

## Live Demo

[Demo](https://pokedex-base.now.sh/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

Run this command first to install all dependency before other command.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
